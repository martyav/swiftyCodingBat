## Solving Problems

To solve a problem, select a file from the Solve Here folder.
When you open the file, you should see an empty class, and a series of class extensions.
Each problem is a single method within its own class extension.
We have added return statements to each method so the compiler won't complain.
Remove the return statement of the problem you want to work on.
Add your own code.
